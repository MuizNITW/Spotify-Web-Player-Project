# Spotify Clone 🎧

A functional Spotify front-end clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✅ Audio playback  
✅ Play/Pause toggle  
✅ Custom UI layout  
✅ Responsive for mobile  
✅ Clean and accessible design

### ⚠️ Important Note

This project is fully functional on a local server. Songs load and play as expected using JavaScript and HTML5 Audio APIs.

However, due to GitHub Pages limitations:
- GitHub does not allow directory listing (required to auto-fetch songs)
- Therefore, audio playback may not work correctly in the deployed version

📁 To test the project locally with full functionality:
1. Clone the repository
2. Use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code)
3. Enjoy the full music player experience

✅ UI, album selection, playlist rendering, and player controls are all functional.
